# 05.2 - Filters

Now that we've learned how to implement heavy-compatible oscillators, we need some filters for our synthesizer. Here we can also use objects from the heavilib-Library. It comes with the `hv.filter~ `-objekt, which can be configured for one of six different filtercurves â€“ allpass, lowpass, highpass, bandpass1, bandpass2 and notch. The example patch _pd03-Filter-Examples.pd_ shows how i implemented four of those filter types. I have used the same custom counter-mechanism as with our oscillators, to select the different filter types with a simple `bang`.

Opening the subpatch _pd Filters_ gives us insight into the mechanism, which lets us choose the different filter types. As the `select~` is not compilable, i used the same custom counter-operation as with our oscillators. As it feeds the numbers 1 to 4 into the `route 1 2 3 4`-object, it will activate only the selected filter type, that corresponds to each number, while deactivating all others. As previously achieved, activating and deactivating is done by a simple signal multiplication with either `0.5` or ` 0 `.
