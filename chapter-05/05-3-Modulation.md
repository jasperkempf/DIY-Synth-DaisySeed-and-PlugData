To expand the sound design possibilities of our Instrument, we'll have a look at implementing two different types of modulation â€“ LFOs (low frequency oscillators) and Envelopes. Both can technically be used to modulate any thinkable parameter of a synth. While LFOs describe a modulation curve, that is running permanently (unless configured otherwise) at the set Rate or frequency, an envelope is typically triggered by incoming note-on and note-off events (typically transmitted through MIDI-Data).
