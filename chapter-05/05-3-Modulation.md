# 05.3 - Modulation

### The example patches for this chapter are _Pd04-LFO-Example_ and _Pd05-Envelopes_.

You can download all example patches <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pd-patches/pd-examples.zip" download>here</a>

To expand the sound design possibilities of our Instrument, we'll have a look at implementing two different types of modulation â€“ LFOs (low frequency oscillators) and Envelopes. Both can technically be used to modulate any thinkable parameter of a synth. While LFOs describe a modulation curve, that is running permanently (unless configured otherwise) at the set Rate or frequency, an envelope is typically triggered by incoming note-on and note-off events (typically transmitted through MIDI-Data).

## LFOs

Our example Patch _Pd04-LFO-Example_ is a simple patch, that lets us select different LFO-waveshapes and visualizes them for demonstrative purposes. Changing the waveform via the Toggle and altering the Frequency via the slider gives us a better understanding of the underlying signal generation that is taking place in the subpatch.

Opening the subpatch `pd LFOs`, we can see that the different LFO-waveforms are generated by 5 `hv.lfo `-objects, configured for the different waveforms sine, ramp, saw, triangle and square. The same counter and route mechanism is used to select activate and deactivate the waveforms upon selection. As the `hv.lfo `-object does not create a signal-output but a float, we cannot employ the simple signal-multiplication to turn it on and off (as we did with our oscillators). 

Instead, i used the `spigot`-object. This is a handy object with two inputs and one output. The right input controls, wether the input on the left inlet is let through the outlet or if it's blocked. Via the ` 1 ` an ` 0 ` messages, we can now control which LFO is sent out of the subpatch.

In the main patch, the float outlet of the subpatch is converted into a signal-stream by using a `sig~`-object. This allows us to use the generated waveform to modulate any parameter, such as the frequency or the amplitude of an oscillator.
