> 📖 The example patch for this chapter are `_Pd04-LFO-Example_`, `_Pd05-LFO-SimpleFM`, `Pd06-OscFM`, `Pd07-LFO-SimpleAM`, `Pd08-1-Envelope` and `Pd08-2-Envelope-Sequence`

## 🪄 Modulation
To expand the sound design possibilities of our Instrument, we will have a look at implementing **two different types of modulation** – `LFOs` (low frequency oscillators) and `envelopes`. Both can technically be used to **modulate any thinkable parameter** of a synth. While `LFOs` describe a modulation curve, that is running permanently (unless configured otherwise) at the defined frequency, an `envelope` is typically triggered by incoming `note-on` and `note-off` events (typically transmitted by MIDI-Data).

## ⚙️ LFOs (Pd04-LFO-Example.pd)

Our example Patch _Pd04-LFO-Example.pd_ is a simple patch, that lets us **select different LFO-waveforms** and visualizes them for demonstrative purposes with a `scope~`. Changing the waveform via `bang` and **altering the frequency via the** `slider` gives us a better understanding of the **underlying signal generation** that is taking place in the subpatch.

→ Opening the subpatch `pd LFOs`, we can see that the different LFO-waveforms are generated by five `hv.lfo `-objects, configured for the different waveforms sine, ramp, saw, triangle and square. The same counter and route mechanism is used to select activate and deactivate the waveforms upon selection. 

> 💡 As the `hv.lfo `-object does not create a signal-output but a float, we cannot employ the simple signal-multiplication to turn it on and off (as we did with our oscillators). Instead, i used the `spigot`-object. This is a handy object with two inputs and one output. The right input controls, wether the input on the left inlet is let through the outlet or if it's blocked. Via the `1 ` and `0 ` messages, we can now control which LFO is sent out of the subpatch.

In the main patch, the float outlet of the subpatch is converted into a signal-stream by using a `sig~`-object. This allows us to use the generated waveform to modulate any parameter, such as the frequency or the amplitude of an oscillator.

### 🔉 Simple Frequency Modulation (Pd05-SimpleFM.pd)

The example Patch _Pd05-SimpleFM.pd_ shows how we can simply use this LFO-Selector to **modulate the frequency of an oscillator**. By using the `+~ `-object, we can add the **LFO-signal** and the **Oscillater-Frequency** signal, before it's transmitted to the `hv.osc sine~`-object.

> 💡 As the Amplitude of the LFO moves **between 0 and 1**, the modulation range is too low for modulating the frequency of an oscillator, as it wouldn't create an audible result.

I added the **FM Depth-control** to extend the range from **between 0 and a maximum of 3000**. This allow us to have a modulation range of up to `+3000Hz` for our **oscillator pitch**.

### 🔊 Frequency Modulation 2 (Pd06-OscFM.pd)

This is a great way for modulating the frequency at lower rates (which an LFO is designed for in the first place). However, for **modulating the pitch of an oscillator at higher frequencies**, the `hv.lfo`-generators didn't provide results that were clean enough to **add pleasant harmonics**. 

This was unfortunate to discover, as FM Synthesis offers the possibility of creating more **complex characteristics out of simple waveforms**. Instead of using `hv.lfo `, i decided to use `hv.osc~ `-generators for **high frequency modulation applications**. The Patch _Pd06-OscFM.pd_ shows an example of how similar results as with `hv.lfo ` can be achieved with `hv.osc~ `. 

<img width="1080" alt="05-03-OscFM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4c4c913-1f0a-44dc-9edb-8f271b18edf9" />

→ The subpatch `_FmEngine_` shows, how the different `hv.osc~ ` generators are activated and controlled.

<img width="1080" alt="05-03-OscFm-Subpatch" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97a50e6b-9c65-428f-8050-825ff6f4f69a" />

> 💡 The downside of this method is, that there are less waveforms available with the `hv.osc~ `-objects than with the `hv.lfo `-generator. If you're planning to implement a "classic" LFO for low frequency modulation, the `hv.lfo ` will be a great choice with a broader selection of available waveforms.

### 📶 Amplitude Modulation (Pd07-LFO-SimpleAM.pd)

To use our LFO **to modulate the amplitude of a signal**, we can simply **multiply the source signal with our modulator signal** using `*~ `. As opposed to our Frequency-Modulation, where we extended the modulation range, this is not necessarily required with amplitude modulation **as values between 0 and 1 cover the entire amplitude range** between silence and full volume. As you can see in the two `scope~`-objects, the signal multiplication causes the output of the oscillator to follow the amplitude of the LFO-waveform.

### 🛎️ Envelopes (Pd.08-1-Envelope.pd), (Pd.08-2-Envelope-Sequence.pd)

To change the character of played notes, we will have a look of implementing **a simple Amplitude-Envelope**. The patch `_Pd.08-2-Envelope-Sequence.pd_` gives an example of what this can look like with a **simple Attack-Release Envelope**. Activating the sequencer in the top-left of the patch will play a simple 4-Note sequence loop, which will allow us to hear the effects of **tweaking the Attack and Release parameters**. 

As visualized by the `scope~`-object, these two parameters alter the envelope of the played note by **either fading it in and out** (long attack and release values), or create **abrupt volume changes** (short attack and release values). 

> 💡 As an alternative to the included sequencer, you can receive MIDI from an outside source (such as a DAW) or hook up a MIDI controller to play notes (needs to be configured in the Plug Data preferences -> MIDI).

<img width="1080" alt="Bildschirmfoto 2025-04-29 um 15 23 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0264f26a-7674-4092-9bef-4a8a9f76ef00" />

→ Opening the subpatch `pd AR Envelope` gives us an impression of how the envelope is generated. Heart of the patch is the `hv.vline~`-object, which is the signal ramp generator. The `hv.vline~`-object will receive a pair of two numbers coming from a message box storing two variables `$1 $2`. 

These two variables store the **velocity and a time value in milliseconds**, telling the `hv.vline~` to reach the **target value of** `$1` in the defined time of `$2`. These two values come from the main patch and **are packed into a list** by the `pack f f`-object. 

As you can see **we have two pairs of** `pack f f` and `$1 $2`-objects. The **left pair** defines the attack-time and target value (based on incoming velocity), the **right pair** the release-time.

> 💡 Plug Data **does not feature** `note-off events` – which could be used to trigger the release of a note – I used the **velocity value of** `0` as trigger for the release. The `select 0`- object will filter an incoming value of `0`, which will **trigger the release-value** and route it to the `hv.vline~`-object. All non-zero velocity values will trigger the attack, causing an audible output from the main patch.
