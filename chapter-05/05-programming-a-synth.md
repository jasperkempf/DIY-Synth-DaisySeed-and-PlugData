# 05 Programming a Synthesizer

In this chapter, we will look at the **possibilities of programming a heavy-compatible Synthesizer in Plug Data.** As providing a full guide on programming with Pd would go too far, i would like to share a few ressources which i've used myself to learn my way around Pd. 

Please keep in mind that those videos are **not necessarily aimed at the use of Plug Data with heavy-compatibility in focus**, but are a good way of getting to know the program and the syntax first.

- Tips & Tricks for working with heavy as well as some known limitations can be found [here](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc/blob/develop/docs/02.getting_started.md)

Once you feel a bit familiar with the way Plug Data works, feel free to follow along with the contents of this chapter below, where we will focus on **programming a synth compatible with a Daisy Seed Microcontroller**.
