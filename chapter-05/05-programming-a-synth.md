# 05 â€“ Programming a Synthesizer

In this chapter, we will look at the possibilities of programming a heavy-compatible Synthesizer in Plug Data. As providing a full guide on programming with Pd would go too far, i would like to share a few ressources i have used to learn my way around Pd. Please keep in mind that those Videos are not aimed at the use of Plug Data with heavy-compatibility in focus, but are a good way of getting to know the program and the syntax first.

Once you feel a bit familiar with the way Plug Data works, feel free to follow along with the contents of this chapter, where we will focus on building a synth which will be compatible with a Daisy Seed Microcontroller.
