# 02 Installations

## ðŸ“¥ Installations

First, we need to make sure the required software is installed. The two main programs we will rely on are:

ðŸŸ  [Plug Data](https://plugdata.org) will serve as our **primary programming environment for building the instrument.**
It is based on **Pure Data Vanilla**, a visual programming language designed for audio and multimedia applications. Plug Data provides a more **user-friendly patching experience** than the original Pure Data, which is one of the reasons I chose it. Another â€” perhaps even more important â€” reason is that **Plug Data includes the heavy Compiler**. We will explore this tool in more detail in [another chapter]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-04/04-3-hvcc), but for now, just know that **itâ€™s essential for compiling and flashing our program** onto the microcontroller.

ðŸ”µ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a **powerful and user-friendly code editor.** While we wonâ€™t use it extensively â€” since most of our programming will happen in Plug Data â€” it plays an important role in **creating custom JSON files**. These JSON files are necessary for telling the Daisy Seed **how to handle the input and output signals** defined in our Plug Data patch. Donâ€™t worry â€” weâ€™ll cover everything you need to know about JSON files later in [this chapter]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-04/04-4-json-file).

> â†’ The graphic above illustrates how the Plug Data patch and the JSON file are connected, and why both need to be flashed together onto the device.

ðŸ”´ Optional: As part of the hardware configuration, Iâ€™ve included Fritzing files (.fzz) that **illustrate the schematics of the hardware component setups** shown in this project. While key assembly information is already provided through annotated screenshots, you also have the option to **open and explore the editable .fzz files directly**. To open these files, youâ€™ll need a Fritzing license, which can be obtained for a small fee from the official [Fritzing website](https://fritzing.org).
