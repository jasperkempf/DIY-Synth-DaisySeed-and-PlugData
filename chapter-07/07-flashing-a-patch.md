# 07 Compiling and flashing a patch

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Flashing a patch with hvcc
Using the hvcc integration, we can Upload ‚Äì or "flash" ‚Äì a patch directly **from Plug Data onto our Daisy Seed Microcontroller**. To do that, we first need to to set the Daisy Seed to Bootloader-Mode, which will allow flashing a new patch. This is done **via the onboard-buttons of the Daisy** as follows:
```
1. Press and hold the `Boot`-button
2. Press and hold the `Reset`-button
3. Let go of the `Reset`-button
4. Let go of the `Boot`-button
```

Having the Daisy connected to our computer via the USB-cable, **we can now flash our patch via the `compile`-section,** which can be found via the dropdown-menu in the top left corner. Here we select `Electro-Smith Daisy`, as well as the patch to be flashed and our JSON-File. As export-Type we choose `Flash`.

**Depending on your project, you need to specify the size in the `Patch-Size`-category.** Depending on the size, the Patch will be flashed to different memories of the Daisy. Choosing `SMALL` will flash the patch to the **internal flash memory,** which has 128kB of storage. **If your project exceeds this size, you should select other options** such as `BIG` - which will flash to SRAM (480kB) - or `BIG + SDRAM`, which will make **additional use of the SDRAM-memory.**

## ‚Üí Press "Flash" to export!‚ö°Ô∏è

When exporting, the **compile window gives us insights of the used memory-region** (you might have to scroll up a bit) as well as **the amount of used percentage per region.** Note that the amount of available SDRAM-Storage can be either 8MB or 64MB, depending on your version of the Daisy Seed.

> üí° When selecting another option than `SMALL`, **the compiler will load the Bootloader into the flash-memory.** This is a program that will **boot our flashed patch from other memory-regions,** such as the SRAM.
