## ðŸ”Š Audio IO

Installing and Audio-In and Output is quite simple with the Daisy. We will use the `Pins 18` and `19` (Audio Out 1&2) for installing a stereo output jack. Vice versa, the `Pins 16 & 17` can be used to install a **stereo input**. The following schematic shows **two variants of stereo jacks** and how they are connected. 

> ðŸ’¡ You would **only need one of the two jacks for a stereo output** (Note that the jacks need to be **stereo components**). If you want to install a **mono jack**, simply **connect only one of the output- (or input) Pins** of the Daisy to the Tip-Connector and the Sleeve-Connector of the jack to ground.

Installing an audio input is very similar and simply requires us to connect the `input pins (16 & 17) ` of the Daisy to our stereo jack as seen here:

In Pd **our Output is declared by creating a** `dac~`-Object (digital to analog converter), an input is created via the `adc~`-Object

In our JSON-File, **we declare two audio channels** with the following code:

```
   "audio": {
        "channels": 2
    },
```

Now we can run a Pd-Patch on the Daisy that will output the signal from the patch via the Output-Pins of the Microcontroller.
