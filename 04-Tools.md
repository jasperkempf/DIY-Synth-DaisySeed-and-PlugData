# 04 – Tools

## Plug Data

We’ve already mentioned some of the benefits of Plug Data in our Installations Chapter (link). However, I want to take a moment to dive a little deeper into the capabilities of this program 
and point out certain features that make it a really great tool for our first project.

Firstly, it’s **open source and completely free to download**. As it is based on Pure Data Vanilla, **a lot of tutorials exist** in the web and **Pure Data patches** **are fully compatible with
Plug Data** (and vice versa) which means there are **many great resources** for beginners to get started patching right away. **The visual programming environment** is also much more beginner-friendly
for people with little or no coding experience. 

Plug Data makes patching **even more comfortable** by introducing features such as **automatic object suggestion**, **signal- and message-flow indication**, **dynamic patching possibilities**
and more. 

Comfortability aside – Plug Data offers **two striking features** that are extremely important for creating our embedded synthesizer with the Daisy Seed. Firstly, **it includes the heavy-compiler collection (hvcc)**. This will allow us, to **upload (or “flash”) our patch directly from Plug Data onto our microcontroller**. Secondly, Plug Data includes the **“compiled mode”**, which – when enabled– **marks
unsupported objects** that cannot be compiled by heavy and will also **exclude them from the object suggestions** that pop up while creating a new object.
