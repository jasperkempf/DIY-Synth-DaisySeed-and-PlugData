Hello!

I am happy to welcome you to this page, where we'll have a look at programming and building a basic synthesizer, using Plug Data and the Daisy Seed Microcontroller. Feel free to follow along with my step by step instructions or simply jump to the chapter you’re most interested in at the moment!
