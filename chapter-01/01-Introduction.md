# 01 Introduction

## Hello! ðŸŒ¼

Welcome to this page! Here, we will explore how to program and build a basic synthesizer **using Plug Data and the Daisy Seed microcontroller**.
Feel free to follow along step by step â€” or jump straight to the chapter that interests you most.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: This course is designed for beginners with little to no prior experience in coding or working with microcontrollers. I hope you will discover useful insights for your own project!

## What we will learn in the following chapters:

- [**02 Installations**]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-02/02-Installations): Overview of the used software.
- [**03 Components**]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-03/03-Components): Overview of the used hardware-components.
- [**04 Tools**]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-04/04-Tools): Description of the Hardware and Software-Tools that we're going to use.
- [**05 Programming a Synth**]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-05/05-programming-a-synth): Programming a heavy-compatible Synthesizer with Plug Data
- [**06 Daisy Hardware Configuration**]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-06/06-Daisy-Hardware-Configuration): Configure a Daisy board and equip it with the necessary components.
- [**07 Flashing a patch**]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-07/07-flashing-a-patch): Upload our heavy-compatible patch onto the Daisy.
- [**08 Outlook and Sources**]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-08/08-outlook): Sources and further information
