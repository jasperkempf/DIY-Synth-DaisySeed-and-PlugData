# 01 – Introduction

Hello!

I am happy to welcome you to my github repository where we program and build a basic synthesizer, using Plug Data and the Daisy Seed Microcontroller. Feel free to follow along with my step by step instructions or simply jump to the chapter you’re most interested in at the moment!

Please Note that this course is aimed at beginners with little to no experience with coding and microcontrollers. I hope you’ll find some interesting information for your project!
