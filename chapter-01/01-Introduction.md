# 01 Introduction

Hello!

Welcome to this page! Here, we’ll explore how to program and build a basic synthesizer using Plug Data and the Daisy Seed microcontroller.
You’re free to follow along step by step — or jump straight to the chapter that interests you most.

Note: This course is designed for beginners with little to no prior experience in coding or working with microcontrollers. I hope you’ll discover useful insights for your own project!
What you'll learn in the upcoming chapters:

**What we will learn in the following chapters:**
