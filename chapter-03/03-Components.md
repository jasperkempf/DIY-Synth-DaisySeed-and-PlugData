# 03 Components
For this Project, we‚Äôre going to need a list of components to bring our Instrument to life.

## Daisy Seed Microcontroller

First and foremost, we need the heart and brain of our instrument ‚Äî **the Daisy Seed microcontroller.**
This microcontroller was designed specifically for creating **embedded audio projects**. It‚Äôs relatively affordable and can be programmed using a variety of languages, including **C++, Max gen~, and Pure Data / Plug Data.** You can purchase the Daisy Seed from the official webshop [here](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed), or check with local electronics retailers in your area ‚Äî they may have it in stock, which could help reduce shipping costs and delivery times.

> We‚Äôll take a closer look at the **features and capabilities of this microcontroller** later in [this Chapter]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-04/04-2-daisy-seed).

To power the Daisy Seed and upload your patch to it, **you will need a micro-USB cable.** Make sure the cable supports **data transfer,** as some micro-USB cables are designed for charging only and cannot transmit data.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: A compatible USB cable is **not included with the Daisy Seed** when you order it!

## Control elements (Switches, Potentiometers)
To control various parameters of our instrument, we will use **potentiometers and switches**. In addition, LEDs can be added to indicate **different states of the instrument** or provide visual feedback when parameters are adjusted. These components are generally **affordable and easy to install**. We will cover **how to work with them in more detail** later in [this Chapter]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-06/06-Daisy-Hardware-Configuration).

## Prototyping electronics (Breadboard, Jumper wires, resistors)

To build our first prototype, we‚Äôll also need a few essential components: **a breadboard, jumper wires, and resistors of various values.** These parts are used to **assemble the circuit** and ensure that certain components ‚Äî like LEDs ‚Äî are **properly protected from damage**.

## MIDI Components 
Thirdly we will need some specific components to install **a MIDI-Port**. In this Project, we will learn how to install a **5-Pin MIDI-Input** to our Daisy Seed, so we require a 5-Pin DIN-Jack, as well as a 5-Pin Midi-cable. **To transform our incoming MIDI-signal into serial-data**, we will need a **6N138 Optocoupler** and a simple **1N914 diode** to protect our circuit.

## Audio-Jack
For this project, I‚Äôve chosen a **6.3mm (¬º inch) stereo jack along with a matching cable.** However, you can also use a 3.5mm stereo or mono jack, depending on the needs of your setup. If you plan to include an audio input ‚Äî for example, when building an **effect pedal** ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to install a second jack to handle that connection.
