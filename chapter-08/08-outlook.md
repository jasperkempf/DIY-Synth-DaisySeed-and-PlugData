# 08 Outlook

In the course of this project, many of the expectable features of a synthesizer have been successfully implemented. This serves as a solid foundation for future projects and the resources collected on this page are meant to provide the required knowledge to get started with Plug Data and the Daisy Seed.

However, if you're currently working on a project, which goes beyond the topics of this page, feel free to check out some of the links i have included in the [sources and links]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-09/09-sources-and-links). Some of the channels and pages there might be able to help finding the required information.

If you have any comments and suggestions for improvement of this page, feel free to reach out to me any time!
