# 04.1 Plug Data

## 🟠 Plug Data

Plug Data is a visual programming environment for audio and multimedia applications, based on Pure Data Vanilla. We have already mentioned some of the benefits of Plug Data in the [Installations Chapter]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-02/02-Installations). However, I want to take a moment to dive a little deeper into the capabilities of this program and **point out certain features that make it a really good tool** for our first project.

## 🟠 Why Plug Data?
Just like Pure Data, Plug Data is **open source and completely free to download**. As it is based on Pure Data Vanilla, **a lot of tutorials exist** in the web and Pure Data patches are **fully compatible with Plug Data** (and vice versa), which means there are many great resources for beginners to get started. 

→ The **visual programming environment** is very **beginner-friendly** for anyone with little or no coding experience. It is even **usable as a Plug-In** in any DAW and can be used to create audio-plugins by exporting a patch as a .VST or .AU plugin via the heavy-compiler integration.

→ Plug Data makes patching more comfortable by introducing features such as **automatic object suggestions, signal- and message-flow feedback**, **dynamic patching possibilities** and more.

→ Comfortability aside – Plug Data offers **two features that are extremely important** for creating our embedded synthesizer with the Daisy Seed. Firstly, it includes the **heavy-compiler**. This will allow us, to **upload (or “flash”) our patch directly from Plug Data onto our microcontroller.**

> Heavy-Compiler integration in Plug Data

→ Furthermore, Plug Data includes the **“compiled mode”**, which – when enabled– **marks unsupported objects that cannot be compiled by heavy** and will also e**xclude them from the object suggestions** that pop up while creating a new object.

### We will look at **building a Synthesizer with Plug Data** in [chapter 05]({{site.baseurl}}/chapter-05/05-programming-a-synth).
