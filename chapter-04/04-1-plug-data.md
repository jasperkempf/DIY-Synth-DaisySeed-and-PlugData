# 04.1 – Plug Data

## Plug Data


We’ve already mentioned some of the benefits of Plug Data in our Installations Chapter (link). However, I want to take a moment to dive a little deeper into the capabilities of this program and point out certain features that make it a really great tool for our first project.

Firstly, as the software is **open source Plug Data is completely free to download**. As it is based on Pure Data Vanilla, **a lot of tutorials exist** in the web and Pure Data patches are **fully compatible with Plug Data** (and vice versa) which means there are many great resources for beginners to get started. The visual programming environment is also much more **beginner-friendly** for people with little or no coding experience. 

Plug Data makes patching even more comfortable by introducing features such as **automatic object suggestions, signal- and message-flow feedback**, **dynamic patching possibilities** and more.

Comfortability aside – Plug Data offers **two features that are extremely important** for creating our embedded synthesizer with the Daisy Seed. Firstly, it includes the **heavy-compiler**. This will allow us, to **upload (or “flash”) our patch directly from Plug Data onto our microcontroller.** Secondly, Plug Data includes the **“compiled mode”**, which – when enabled– **marks unsupported objects that cannot be compiled by heavy** and will also e**xclude them from the object suggestions** that pop up while creating a new object.

We will look into **building a Synthesizer with Plug Data** in Chapter 05
