# 04.3 - Heavy Compiler Collection (hvcc)

This is an excerpt from the official heavy documentation:

_“Heavy is a **framework for easily generating audio plugins** for use in interactive sound and music applications such as **games, instruments or installations.**
It aims to **reduce the dependency on low-level programming** from a creative standpoint and **bridge the gap from idea to production-ready implementation.**
Heavy makes use of modern software principles to generate **highly optimised C/C++ code** specifically targeting a wide variety of popular hardware architectures and software frameworks. It can also automatically build plugin binaries for these platforms.”_

We will use heavy through the compile window in Plug Data, aside from its practical use this is all we need to know about it for now. If you want to learn more about heavy, check out their official documentation [here](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc)
